# 🛠️ GitHub Configuration Repository

This repository contains my **global GitHub configuration**.  
It is not a project codebase — instead, it defines shared standards, templates, and automation that apply across all of my repositories.

## 📂 Contents

- **profile/README.md**  
  Personal profile page shown at [github.com/nruin7](https://github.com/nruin7).  

- **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/**  
  Standard pull request templates (feature, bugfix, docs, chore, general).  

- **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**  
  Standard issue templates (bug reports, feature requests, documentation updates, chores) and `config.yml` for template behavior.  

- **workflows/**  
  GitHub Actions used for repository-wide automation, such as syncing labels across all repos.  

- **labels.yml**  
  Source of truth for labels that are synced into other repositories.  

## 🔧 Purpose

This repo helps me maintain:

- ✅ Consistent **PR and issue standards** across projects  
- ✅ A professional **GitHub profile landing page**  
- ✅ Automated **label synchronization** across repositories  
- ✅ A single source of truth for global GitHub setup  

## 📌 Notes

- This repo is intentionally **public** so the profile README displays on my GitHub profile.  
- Workflow files in `.github/workflows/` run under the **Actions** tab of this repo.  
- Other repositories automatically inherit these templates unless overridden locally.  

---
⭐ This is the foundation of my GitHub presence — providing consistency, professionalism, and automation across all of my work.
