# 👋 Hi, I'm Noah Ruimveld

I’m an automation engineer and systems developer with a passion for **building robust software and connected systems**.  
My work spans from **low-level C++ socket applications** to **embedded IoT systems** to **custom UI applications**.  
I also have a strong background in **industrial robotics, PLCs, 3D modeling/printing, and web development** — while not all of that work lives here on GitHub, it shapes how I approach engineering and design.

## 🔧 What I Do
- 🖥️ **C++ Systems Development** – Modernizing legacy applications, building cross-version Windows tools.
- 🌐 **IoT & Embedded** – ESP32 (Wi-Fi + Thread), Matter integration, Arduino devices, and real-world control systems.
- ⚡ **Smart Home Engineering** – Designing robust Matter-enabled devices and Home Assistant UI extensions.
- 📊 **Visualization & SCADA** – Custom GUI applications with TCP/UDP SCADA data links.
- 🌐 **Web Development** – Full stack development for industrial and personal projects.
- 🛠️ **Code Quality & Reliability** – Validation/debugging tools, structured workflows, and engineering discipline.

## 🚀 Current GitHub Projects
- **SocketLibraryCPP** – C++ Windows socket static library for standalone systems and SCADA/automation integrations.
- **Smart Matter Relay** – ESP32-C6 Thread or Wi-Fi compatible relay controller for smart homes.
- **RFID Inspections** – RFID-based offline/online industrial inspection platform.
- **BluepadGPIOBridge** - Arduino library for expanding GPIO capabilities of Bluepad powered ESP devices.
